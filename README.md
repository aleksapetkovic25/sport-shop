Using technology
Frontend:
•Java Script (framework Vue)
•HTML
•CSS.

Backend:
•NodeJS

Base:
•MySQL
The focus is on the frontend. The backend is as hollow as Swiss cheese. It serves only for communication with the base.
For images in the database, I put only the name of the image and then set the path from the front. I didn't put in the binary since I haven't really researched it.
